      Soccer, also known as football around the world, is one of the most popular
      sports ever played. The game has existed for hundreds of years, with early
      versions appearing in places like China, Greece, and Rome. But the modern
      form of soccer that we know today started in England in the 1800s when the
      first official rules were created.
      <br><br>
      The goal of the game is simple: score more goals than the other team. Each
      team has 11 players, including the goalkeeper, and they play on a large
      field trying to move the ball without using their hands. The sport is fast,
      competitive, and takes a mix of skill, strategy, teamwork, and endurance.
      <br><br>
      Soccer is also a global language—people everywhere play it, watch it, and
      celebrate it. The World Cup, the biggest soccer tournament, is watched by
      billions. Players like Lionel Messi, Cristiano Ronaldo, and Neymar have
      become worldwide icons and inspire millions of kids. Even tho Ronaldo is lowk buns

      What makes soccer so special is how simple but fun it is.
